# Project 3 Data Analysis and Web Scraping #

## Sub Project 3.1 - Integrins ## 


## Sub Project 3.2 - BCL2-Like_BAX ##

The second part of the third project is similar to the first part. However, while the first part dealt with `Target Pref. Name = Integrins`, which appeared many times in the *DLiP* database, and therefore, we switched those values with more specific ones from the *chEMBL* database, obtaining even more data because many molecules with `Target Pref. Name = Integrins` had more than one match with the corresponding values in the *chEMBL* database (as a reminder, we joined the data frames by the SMILES molecule values). In this part of the project (i.e., 3.2), we are going to deal with `Target Pref. Name = BCL2-Like_BAX`.
